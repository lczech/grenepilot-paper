this is the comparison of seed frequencies to each other, using different calling methods.
the idea is to run variant calling with different tools (freebayes, gatk, bcftools, and simple pileups),
and to then compare how the resulting frequencis across positions differ.

to this end, we use the grenepipe runs located at
/lustre/scratch/lczech/grenepipe-runs/ath-evo-seeds-*
and the scripts in this directory to obtain frequency tables and make plots.
